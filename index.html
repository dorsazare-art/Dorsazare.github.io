					<b>Title of the work:</b> Emotional Support Pet <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Web Program - JavaScript <br>
				</p>
				<p> <b>Intention</b>
					My game project, created as part of the Creative Computation course in the Computational Arts
					department, aims to provide players with a unique avenue for emotional exploration and
					self-expression. I wanted to develop a game that goes beyond mere entertainment and offers players a
					therapeutic experience to engage with their emotions in a meaningful way. </p>

				<p> <b> Process:</b>
					Using Procreate for visual design and JavaScript for programming, I crafted a game where players are
					prompted to reflect on their current emotional state. Based on their feelings, the game suggests
					mini-games tailored to their emotions. For example, if a player is feeling angry, they might be
					guided to a calming painting game where they can release their emotions by virtually painting a
					wall. The emphasis was on creating a stress-free and satisfying experience that encourages players
					to express themselves authentically rather than escape from their feelings. This project represents
					my commitment to using technology as a tool for emotional healing.</p>

					<b>Title of the work:</b> Save the Environment <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Web Program - JavaScript <br>
				</p>
				<p> <b>Intention</b>
					I created "Save the Environment" game as part of the Creative Computation course in the
					Computational Arts
					department. This game is designed to immerse players in small, impactful actions to combat climate
					change. It aims to demonstrate the ease and effectiveness of making a difference by engaging in
					virtual tasks like cleaning up garbage and planting trees, with the intention of inspiring real-life
					action.
					<br>
				<p><b>Process:</b>
					Illustrated using Procreate and programmed with JavaScript, the game prompts players to choose
					actions to help the environment. After completing tasks, players are encouraged to replicate their
					actions in real life, leveraging the game experience to enact positive change. This project
					underscores my commitment to using technology to promote environmental awareness and activism. </p>

					<b>Title:</b> Living Room <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Digital Art - Blender

					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Intention:</b> This is a Personal Project that I worked on since I am passionate about creating
					3D environments.
					<br>
					<b>Process:</b> The Blender software was used to create this 3D Living Room. The modelling approach
					is described briefly here. I began with the main geometry and then individually adjusted the shapes
					in edit mode. I chose blue and yellow as the main colours for this living room, which is different
					from the tutorial. I changed the texture of the objects, particularly the curtains, to make them
					more transparent, and I increased the metallic level of the light fixture. Two area lights were then
					installed to brighten the space and background. The camera was then adjusted and rendered from
					various angles.

					<b>Title:</b> Bedroom <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Digital Art - Blender

					<br>
					<br>

					<b>Intention:</b> This is a Personal Project that I worked on in order to create another type of 3D
					room with a different theme.
					<br>
					<b>Process:</b> This 3D bedroom was created using Blender. I started with the walls and the floor,
					then added each piece of furniture and item individually and tweaked the shapes in edit mode. I also
					changed the colours and textures. For this bedroom, I chose green as the base colour and added wood
					to the furniture and yellow to the objects to make the room look warmer and cozier. Finally, I
					adjusted the lights and camera and rendered the model.

					<b>Title:</b> Mushrooms in a bottle <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Digital Art - Blender <br>
					<br>

					<b>Intention:</b> This was a personal project that I worked on since I love making imaginative 3D
					environments.
					<br>
					<b>Process:</b> Blender software was used to build this model. I started with the mushrooms and
					small objects around it, then added the bottle. I changed the material of the bottle to make it look
					like glass and eliminated some of the light reflections. I added stars and light circles to the
					background to make it more interesting. The blurry light circles effect was created by drawing
					little circles and positioning them very close to the camera. When the camera's focus is on the
					primary item, the small circles become blurry, resulting in this lens flare effect.

					<b>Title:</b> Fox <br>
					<b>Date of completion:</b> 2023 <br>
					<b>Medium:</b> Digital Art - Blender <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Intention:</b> This is a Personal Project that I worked on to learn more about creating 3D
					characters.
					<br>
					<b>Process:</b> This 3D fox character was produced in Blender. I started by making the fox's overall
					head and body, added the details, such as the tail, white portions, and eyes, etc., and then
					individually changed the colours and textures of each part. I added the bottom green circle and
					added a background to the character to help it stand out on a surface. Lastly I added two
					area lights to either side of the character.
