														 <br>
														 <br>
														
														 Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on since I am passionate about creating 3D environments.
														 <br> Process: 
														 The Blender software was used to create this 3D Living Room. The modelling approach is described briefly here. I began with the main geometry and then individually adjusted the shapes in edit mode. I chose blue and yellow as the main colours for this living room, which is different from the tutorial. I changed the texture of the objects, particularly the curatins, to make them more transparent, and I increased the metallic level of the light fixture. Two area lights were then installed to brighten the space and background. The camera was then adjusted and rendered from various angles.

															  <br>
															  <br>
															 
															  Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on in order to create another type of 3D room with a different theme.
															  <br> Process: 
															  This 3D bedroom was created using Blender. I started with the walls and the floor, then added each piece of furniture and item individually and tweaked the shapes in edit mode. I also changed the colours and textures. For this bedroom, I chose green as the base colour and added wood to the furniture and yellow to the objects to make the room look warmer and cozier. Finally, I adjusted the lights and camera and rendered the model. <br>

														 <br>
														
														 Intention: This was a personal project that I worked on since I love making imaginative 3D environments.
														 <br> Process: 
														 Blender software was used to build this model. I started with the mushrooms and small objects around it, then added the bottle. I changed the material of the bottle to make it look like glass and eliminated some of the light reflections. I added stars and light circles to the background to make it more interesting. The blurry light circles effect was created by drawing little circles and positioning them very close to the camera. When the camera's focus is on the primary item, the small circles become blurry, resulting in this lens flare effect.		 <br>

														<br>
														<br>
														 Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on to learn more about creating 3D characters. 
														 <br> Process: 
														 This 3D fox character was produced in Blender. I started by making the fox's overall head and body, added the details, such as the tail, white portions, and eyes, etc., and then individually changed the colours and textures of each part. I added the bottom green circle and added a background to the character to help it stand out on a surface. I followed that by adding two area lights to either side of the character. Lastly, I adjusted the camera and rendered from several angles. <br>

								<br />
								Intention and Process: This is a personal project. In this animated GIF, I attempted to illustrate a feeling of freedom in which 
								the paper airplane is flying freely like a child’s imagination
							regardless of the things happening in the world underneath. 
							The paper airplane can symbolize childhood, imagination, hopes, and dreams.

									<br>
									Intention: This artwork is a personal project which was inspired by the Zayandeh Rood River in Isfahan, one of Iran's main tourist attractions,
									which has dried up. 
									 Farmers have intermittently protested the lack of attention given to the issue but they were stopped by the local government.

								Title: Metro musician <br>
								Date of completion: 2022 <br>
								Medium: Sound Montage <br>
								<br>
								<br>

								Intention: This is a class project that I completed for the Sound course (COMS 276) last semester.
								<br>I used to play the violin in the subway and loved the experience and the sounds all around me. That felt more than just playing the violin on the subway to earn some coins. I felt the same way I did when I was on stage with an orchestra.
								Because I can hear the orchestral instruments in my head even when I'm playing alone. Besides that, the metro's soundscape is very intriguing. There is an echo. The wind created by the metro will occasionally accompany me. Having said that, in this piece, I attempted to combine my music, imagination, and metro sounds.
								<br> Process: I recorded all of the sounds myself, including the Montreal metro and the instruments heard in the background. I recorded each melody on my violin separately, then combined the audio files in Audacity software to mix them and then I added echo and other necessary effects.
